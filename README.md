## :bookmark: Guitar Shop e-commerce :bookmark:

This project is an ecommerce called Guitar shop, where we have products which can be added to a shopping cart, user creation to identify purchases by users with **MongoDb** database, the back-end management is done in **Nodejs**, the front-end is based on **html** and **Handlebars** templates, styled with **CSS** and the handling of **AJAX** calls is done in **Javascript**. The user can create a user, to access the home through the login, the project routes are protected with the session query so that if they are not logged in, they cannot access certain routes, if they have admin access, they can access to a special route to register another admin that can handle certain information on the page such as adding new products to the database that will be added in the next features.
